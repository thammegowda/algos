    "# Column Transpose Decipher\n",
    "\n",
    "This note book is an attempt to solve the text decryption problem posted at http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/people/transpose.html \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement:\n",
    "1. There are 10 rows, each of them are independent.\n",
    "2. There are 50 columns.\n",
    "3. Cryptographic tenchnique - transpose cipher\n",
    "3. Traspose technique: Columns are reorded/shuffled\n",
    "4. Key: the sequence of columns that when the message is read left to right yields english or english like message\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the majority of cracking techniques, the goal here is to search for a valid combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges for Search:\n",
    "1. **Tractability:**\n",
    "  There are 50 Columns, meaning that there are $50! = 3.0414093e+64$ combinations. So, an exhaustive search is expensive in terms of CPU cycles and time.\n",
    "2. **Stop condition:** How do we know a combination of columns is a valid answer so that we can stop the search or atleast we can mark the state as a solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "1. **Tractability:**  \n",
    "    The blind search yields $50! = 3.0414093e+64$ combinations which is not tractable. So, we need to incorporate intelligence search into the search. We may take advantage of english vocabulary to restrict the search. \n",
    "    a. Detect early when the search is going in wrong/invalid branch and stop -- done in this notebook  \n",
    "    b. Rank the branches based on probability of yielding a valid search. For example, `th --> e` is more likely an answer than the `th --> x` -- *Not done in this notebook, may be it is not needed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stop Condition:**  \n",
    "  a. All the columns are used/fit in the solution  \n",
    "  b. The text in each row is segmented properly. That is, except the last word, all internal words are valid as per the dictionary. The last word may be incomplete since the text is cut off at 50th column.  \n",
    "  c. There can be multiple candidate solutions. So the search continues to produce all possible solutions.\n",
    "3. **The ranking**:\n",
    "  If there are multiple candidates, then each one of them is ranked as per language model and the highest possible candidate is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## External  requirements\n",
    "1. `Dictionary` - dictionary of valid words -- Used in this notebook  \n",
    "    a. Includes **all** the words in given message  \n",
    "    b. Large enough to cover all the words, however minimal enough to restrict the search\n",
    "2. `Language Model` - probabilities of occurrence of words, bigrams and hopefully trigrams \n",
    "  -- *Not Yet used in this notebook*\n",
    "   Since the input consists of 10 rows, together all the 10 rows serves the same purpose as a language model. In otherwords, it is extremely unlikely to fit gibberish text for all the 10 rows at the same time!\n",
    "   \n",
    "### What could possibly go wrong\n",
    "1. Solution not reached: Dictionary doesn't include at least one word that is neccessary to check the validity\n",
    "2. Intractable search: Dictionary includes too many words or invalid words, thus making this search intractable.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a quick fix, scraped common words from  OGDEN's Basic English Combined Word Lists at http://ogden.basic-english.org/word2000.html\n",
