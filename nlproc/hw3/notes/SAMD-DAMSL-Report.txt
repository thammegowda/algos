Assignment 3 Report

1. If you included files other than baseline_crf.py, advanced_crf.py, evaluate_model.py, and hw3_corpus_tool.py, or modified hw3_corpus_tool.py please describe what the files do and/or your modifications to hw3_corpus_tool.py.

I included a file named `crfcore.py` which includes code from TAs.
I modified get_data() method to return file name as well alongside utterances.

2. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features

I shuffled the files and splitted the dataset into 75% for training and 25% for development.
The splitting was done as below:
  ls data/**.csv | gshuf > paths.txt

Then the first 75% of files in the paths.txt were copied to "train" directory and the rest 25% were copied to the "dev".
For both the baseline and advanced versions, i trained on the "train" directory and evaluated on the "dev" directory.
The evaluation is performed as follows:
 Built a confusing matrix, where row headers are ground truth labels and column headers are predicted labels.
 The trace of this matrix is calculated (i.e. sum of all the values in diagonal)
 The total is calculated by summing the values in all the cells of matrix.
The performance measure is the fraction of trace / total
 

3. Describe your advanced feature set.
    a) added EOD feature for the last utterance in dialgue.
    b) Added bigrams of tokens
    c) Added bigrams of Part of speech
  

4. If you tried alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them.
    d) Added positional tokens TOK[<i>]=<token>, where <i> is the position of <token> in the utterance.
    e) Added PREV_* and NEXT_* as features from previous and next utterance when available.
5. Accuracy of baseline features was:
   72.7%
6. Accuracy of advanced features was:
   73.78%
