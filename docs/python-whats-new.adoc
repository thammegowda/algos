For a long time I have been stuck at v3.7. This document is for educating myself about new features of Python language. 

Focusing on new syntax features and helpful utilities.

== 3.10 

:link:https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html

=== Structural pattern matching 
=== Union of types as `X|Y`
=== Context manager with paranthesis
```
with (
    CtxManager1() as example1,
    CtxManager2() as example2,
    CtxManager3() as example3,
):
```
=== `zip` has `strict` argument to enfore same lenghts


== 3.9 

:link:https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html

=== Dictionary merge and update `a|b` or `a|=b`
=== Type hinting generics in standard collections: `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]` 

=== 3.8 

:link:https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html 

=== Assignment expression aka walrus operator `:=`
```
# re search
discount = 0.0
if (mo := re.search(r'(\d+)% discount', advertisement)):
    discount = float(mo.group(1)) / 100.0

# loop 
while (block := f.read(256)) != '':
    process(block)
```
=== Position only parameters seperated by `/`
```
# a, b must be specified as position only
def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)
```
=== f-strings support `=` for self-documenting expressions
```
>>>user = 'eric_idle'
>>>member_since = date(1975, 7, 31)
>>>f'{user=} {member_since=}'
"user='eric_idle' member_since=datetime.date(1975, 7, 31)"

# format specifiers
>>> delta = date.today() - member_since
>>> f'{user=!s}  {delta.days=:,d}'
'user=eric_idle  delta.days=16,075'
```
=== `asyncio.run()` is now a stable API
